- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m _@ariffazman_ from **Malaysia** ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m very much interested in _automating_ stuffs
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be as _efficient_ as possible
- ğŸ¤– That means I spend _hours_ scripting than do it manually in _minutes_
- ğŸ¦¥ Because _I'm lazy_ and dislike spending my time doing the same thing over & over again
- ğŸ“« Reach me during these ğŸ•˜ UTC+08 ğŸ•• times. For other times, requires other way to reach~ ğŸ˜„
